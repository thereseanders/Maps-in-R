# USC POIR Workshop on Maps in `R` (5 April 2017)

This workshop provides a first introduction to visualizing spatial data in `R`. We will use a number of `R` packages, including but not limited to `ggmap`, `maptools`, `maps`, and `rgeos` to acquire and manage map data. All plotting will be done in `ggplot2`.
