# USC POIR Workshop on Maps in `R` (5 April 2017)

This workshop provides a first introduction to visualizing spatial data in `R`. We will use a number of `R` packages, including but not limited to `ggmap`, `maptools`, `maps`, and `rgeos` to acquire and manage map data. All plotting will be done in `ggplot2`.

You will need [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed on your machine. If you do not yet have these on your computer, please download and install [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) prior to the workshop.

* Instructor: [Therese Anders](dornsife.usc.edu/anders).
* Workshop is sponsored by the [USC Graduate Student Government](https://gsg.usc.edu).
