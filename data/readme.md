# Data for the workshop

* `clean_airquality.R`: `R` code to subset the `daily_88101_2016.csv` file and save the resulting file as `cleaned_airquality.csv`.
* `clean_india_pcndp.R`: `R` code to clean/reshape the `india_pcndp.xls` file and save the resulting file as `cleaned_india_pcndp.csv`.
* `cleaned_airquality.csv`: Cleaned data for California air quality measurements in 2016. The original data file, `daily_88101_2016.csv`, as downloaded from the EPA (https://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html), is too large to be uploaded here. This repository therefore contains only the cleaned data.
* `cleaned_india_pcndp.csv`: Cleaned/reshaped data for the per capita net domestic product of Indian federal states.
* `/IND_adm_shp/`: Folder containing the GADM shape file data for Indian federal states (contains .dbf, .shp, and .shx files, source: http://www.gadm.org/country).
* `india_pcndp.xls`: Data on per capita net domestic product of Indian federal states (source:  https://data.gov.in/resources/capita-net-state-domestic-product-current-prices).
